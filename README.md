# **Tic Tac Toe Game**




This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to compete, taking turns to place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The player who successfully aligns three of their marks vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.

The interface is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, providing a smooth gameplay experience across different devices. The game also includes logic to detect when a player has won or when the game ends in a draw. It's a fun and easy way to pass time while testing your strategic thinking skills!

Feel free to explore the code and enjoy playing!
